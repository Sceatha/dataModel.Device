# dataModel.Device
These data models allow to represent devices of different nature (IoT, mobile, wearable, etc.).

The following entity types are available:
- [Device](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Device/blob/master/Device/README.md). An apparatus (hardware + software + firmware) intended to accomplish a
particular task (sensing the environment, actuating, etc.).


- [DeviceModel](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Device/blob/master/DeviceModel/README.md). This entity captures the static properties of a Device. 


The list of incubated (on development) data models are:
